Notes:
I decided against using a interface for this simple task of creating the prime numbers. 
I could have used a static class but I think it is perfectly fine to use poor man DI in certain scenarios such as this. 
I based the prime numbers on this algorithim below:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
I could have done more variations on the multiplication part for the unit tests but ran out of time, but I hope that is enough. 
I realise for further memory optimisation in GetPrimeList(int primeNumber) a BitArray could be used.

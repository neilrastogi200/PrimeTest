Notes:
I decided against using a interface for this simple task of creating the prime numbers. 
I could have used a static class but I think it is perfectly fine to use poor man DI in certain scenarios such as this. 
I based the prime numbers on this algorithim below:

I could have done more variations on the multipication part for the unit tests but ran out of time, but I hope that is enough.
